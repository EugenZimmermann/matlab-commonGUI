Collection of GUI helper functions for all my matlab programs https://github.com/EugenZimmermann

Place on same level as program folders, i.e.:

- Matlab
- Matlab/CommonGUI
- Matlab/CommonGUI/CommonGUIFunctionX.m
- Matlab/ProgramY
- Matlab/ProgramY/MainProgramY.m

Due to a significant change in graphics handling with Matlab 2014b this program is NOT COMPATIBLE TO MATLAB 2014a AND BELOW.
